## üìã Overview

The Anonymous Marathon Registration System revolutionizes traditional race management by leveraging blockchain technology and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect participant privacy. Runners can register for events, submit sensitive personal data, and compete without revealing their identities or private information to organizers or other participants.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

At the heart of this system is FHE technology, which allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

- **Privacy Protection**: Personal information (age, experience level, previous race times) remains encrypted at all times
- **Verifiable Results**: Race organizers can verify eligibility and calculate results without accessing raw participant data
- **Zero-Knowledge Participation**: Runners compete under anonymous identifiers while maintaining data integrity

### Anonymous Marathon Registration

The system enables complete privacy in competitive running events:

1. **Encrypted Profile Data**: Age, experience level, and historical performance data are encrypted on submission
2. **Anonymous Identifiers**: Each participant selects a unique anonymous ID for public-facing race activities
3. **Privacy-Preserving Leaderboards**: Results can be displayed and ranked without compromising participant identities
4. **Secure Prize Distribution**: Winners can be verified and rewarded through smart contracts without revealing personal details

### Smart Contract Architecture

The system utilizes blockchain smart contracts to ensure:

- **Decentralized Trust**: No single entity controls participant data
- **Transparent Operations**: All race rules and logic are publicly verifiable
- **Immutable Records**: Race results and registrations cannot be tampered with
- **Automated Execution**: Registration, verification, and prize distribution happen automatically

## üéØ Key Features

### For Runners

- **Privacy-First Registration**: Submit personal data that remains encrypted end-to-end
- **Anonymous Competition**: Participate under pseudonyms while maintaining competitive integrity
- **Secure Data Storage**: All sensitive information protected by cryptographic encryption
- **Transparent Results**: View race outcomes and leaderboards without compromising privacy

### For Organizers

- **Encrypted Data Management**: Access aggregated insights without viewing individual participant details
- **Fair Competition**: Verify participant eligibility without accessing raw personal data
- **Automated Administration**: Smart contracts handle registration, verification, and results
- **Fraud Prevention**: Cryptographic proofs ensure data integrity and prevent cheating

### Technical Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum-compatible networks
- **MetaMask Support**: Easy wallet connection for seamless user experience
- **Real-time Updates**: Live leaderboards and race status
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Marathon Creation

Organizers create new marathon events by specifying:
- Event name and date
- Registration deadline
- Maximum participant capacity
- Registration fee (optional)

### 2. Participant Registration

Runners register by providing:
- **Encrypted Personal Data**: Age, experience level, previous best time
- **Anonymous Identifier**: A unique pseudonym for public display
- **Registration Fee**: Paid in cryptocurrency via smart contract

All personal data is encrypted using FHE before being stored on the blockchain.

### 3. Race Participation

During the event:
- Runners compete under their anonymous identifiers
- Finish times are recorded and encrypted
- Real-time leaderboards display anonymous rankings

### 4. Results & Verification

After race completion:
- Encrypted finish times are processed using FHE computations
- Winners are determined without decrypting individual data
- Prize distribution is automated through smart contracts
- Participants can verify their encrypted results

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Protection

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All personal data encrypted before leaving user's device
- **On-Chain Privacy**: Encrypted data stored on blockchain, never exposed
- **Anonymous Identifiers**: Public-facing pseudonyms protect real identities
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Verify data integrity without decryption

### Security Measures

- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Thoroughly tested contract logic
